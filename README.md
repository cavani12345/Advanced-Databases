# Advanced-Databases Module

## Purpose 

This repository serves as a central hub for all assignments completed as part of the **Advanced Database** module. The repository is organized into multiple base folders, each representing a specific assignment, referred to as **CATs** (e.g., `CAT`, `Assignment`, `Exam`.).  

Each CAT folder contains all relevant files for that assignment, including SQL scripts and additional resources such as screenshots  

Additionally, **each CAT folder includes its own `README.md` file**, which provides detailed information about the specific assignment, including objectives, project structure, implemented queries. This approach ensures that every assignment is **self-contained and easy to navigate** while maintaining a clear and consistent organization across the repository.
